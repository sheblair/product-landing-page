### README for product-landing-page (freeCodeCamp project in Responsive Web Design Certification Curriculum)

So I've mostly fixed all the errors and issues with making this site repsonsive, and I've added two breakpoints (768px for tablet and 1200px for desktop) BUT there are a couple of issues that remain, which I haven't yet resolved:

1. The original project stipulated a fixed navbar that should always be at the top of the viewport. I set this up using position: sticky, but this isn't quite the same as position: fixed, which I think is what the original project wanted. The problem is that I can't figure out how to make position: fixed work in Flexbox. I'm sure there must be a way but the fact that it takes the element out of the doc flow is stumping me.
2. There are still some spacing and layout issues that should be tweaked. Really minor stuff but makes a huge difference in terms of a page looking quite streamlined and elegant vs. just not having any glaring errors.
